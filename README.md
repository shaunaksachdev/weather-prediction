# Weather Prediction using Ridge Regression

This project uses machine learning to predict precipitation and temperature based on historical weather data from the [National Centers for Environmental Information (NCDC)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search). A Ridge Regression model was implemented using Python and scikit-learn, with feature engineering techniques applied to improve model accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing:** Historical weather data from the NCDC is processed and cleaned using Pandas.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques like rolling averages and expanding means were used to enhance model performance.
- **Modeling:** Ridge Regression implemented using scikit-learn to predict precipitation and temperature.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), achieving a result of 8.85%.

## Results

The Ridge Regression model achieved a **MAPE of 8.85%**, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting precipitation and temperature values.
